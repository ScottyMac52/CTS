Thrustmaster Recovery Checklist (AVA + Warthog + MFDs)

1. Uninstall driver package
   - In Apps & Features: remove “Thrustmaster Drivers” (HOTAS/TPR).
   - Leave TARGET installed.

2. Purge device instances + old drivers
   - Plug in all TM gear.
   - Run the purge script (removes all VID_044F devices + Thrustmaster OEM drivers).
   - When it prints “HARD RESET COMPLETE,” unplug everything and reboot.

3. Reinstall drivers
   - Run the HOTAS/TPR driver installer as Admin, with devices unplugged.
   - When prompted, plug devices in one by one.
   - Finish installer and reboot.

4. Apply filter drivers
   - Run TARGET Device Analyzer (Admin).
   - Click Enumerate HID Devices.
   - For each device (AVA, Throttle, MFD1–4), click Install filter.
   - Reboot.

5. Verify
   - Open joy.cpl → confirm Thrustmaster Combined is present and responsive.
   - Device Manager → System devices → Thrustmaster Bus Enumerator should list all devices.
   - Launch DCS → profile initializes with “main returned 0”.
